# Workshop: Introduction to R for ADF&G Fishery Researchers
_Short introductory course for learning the basics of R, tailored for ADF&G fishery biologists._  


## Course Approach
This course does not assume that you have any prior R knowledge, so don't be intimidated!  

Attendees will watch the instructor present the PowerPoint presentation. At the end of each section, students will either work through the scripts that were associated with that section or in a "learnr" tutorial. In the `code` folder there are several groups of scripts. In general, these belong to one of three groups.  
**Tutorials:** There are several "learnr" tutorials, each contained in their own folder.  
**Scripts:** A stand-alone script that demonstrates PowerPoint concepts, and will either be reviewed together or independently.  
**Motivating Examples:** Completed scripts showcasing several types of analyses, charts, and data types.  

Code is numbered to be associated with each section in the PowerPoint, i.e., concepts covered in PowerPoint Section 2 "Basic Programming" correspond to code reviewed in `Tutorial_2_Basics` and in the script `2_Basic_Programming.R`  

To run the learnr tutorials on your own computer you will need to paste the following code into R and then run it:  
`install.packages(c("learnr", "shiny", "tidyverse", "lubridate"))`  
Then opened the desired tutorial script in RStudio and click "Run Document" above the script pane. 

## Agenda
This course will be split over two days of just over 4 hours each day.
Before each section we will take a small break.

## Course Outcomes
- Recognize basic codes / commands. Recall resources  
- Know the how & why of what code does  
- Use this knowledge in new situations to create a visualization  


## Expected Behavior
Be kind: all else is details. _Remember, this includes being kind to YOU_  
We are teaching & learning this together. _Teach each other_  
Every mistake is a lesson. _Ask me or yourself why something didn’t work_
