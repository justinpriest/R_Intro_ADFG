# This section will rely heavily on using the package "dplyr" 
# You can do everything that we'll cover using just base R but it's often more cumbersome
# We'll cover more about dplyr and the tidyverse later


# Topics to cover
# Change column names
# Add new column (mutate)
# Delete rows/columns
# Filter
# Group_by
