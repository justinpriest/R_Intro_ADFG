## The Palmer Penguin Dataset

```{r look-at-these-penguins, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/lter_penguins.png")

```


### Data background

*The dataset we'll be working with summarizes a penguin monitoring project at 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. Data were collected on 3 different species of penguins.*
*These data are from the package "palmerpenguins", supported by the Palmer Station LTER.*
*More info is found at https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/*

Before proceeding to learn how to plot, the first step is reviewing data. Here's what the dataset looks like using `head(penguins)`
```{r penguin-data-head, exercise.eval=TRUE}
head(penguins)
```

<br>
Here's the last rows of the dataset using `tail(penguins)`
```{r penguin-data-tail, exercise.eval=TRUE}
tail(penguins)
```

<br>
And here's a quick count of data by species using `penguins %>% count(species)`
```{r penguin-data-summ, exercise.eval=TRUE}
penguins %>%
  count(species)
```
You can see that monitoring took place over several years and measurements were of bill length/depth, flipper length, mass, and sex. 



## ggplot2 Basics

*The R package "ggplot2" makes plotting very easy. However, there are several parts to know about a ggplot.*  
*First, ggplot lines are added together using a "+".*  
*There are 3 essential parts of a ggplot: data, aesthetic, and geom type. The data source is self-explanatory. The aesthetic is where we tell R aspects such as which column will be the:*  
- x axis  
- y axis  
- grouping variable  
- line/point color  
- bar/area fill color  
- shape  

*These are set inside the* `ggplot()` *command using* `aes()`. *So the essential setup might be:*  
`ggplot(data = mydataframe, aes(x = xcolumnname, y = ycolumnname))`  

*Last, we'll need to tell what kind of plot we're going to make. This is set by "geom_xxxx", e.g.,* `geom_line` *, * `geom_point()`*, or * `geom_col()` *for line, scatterplot points, and bar charts. *  

*Putting this all together, a basic ggplot might look like this:*  
`ggplot(data = mydataframe, aes(x = xcolumnname, y = ycolumnname)) +`  
    `geom_point()`



## Penguin Flipper Scatterplot

### Flipper Plot - Exercise 1 
*Let's plot the variable* `flipper_length_mm` *against * `body_mass_g` *to look at the relationship between how flippers increase with body mass. *

Add the correct geom to the plot below to create a scatterplot:
```{r flipper-ex1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g)) 

```

```{r flipper-ex1-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()
```


### Flipper Plot - Exercise 2a
*Let's throw some color in there!*
*There's two places to add a color argument: *
- Inside the "geom" (static, color is constant)
- Inside the aes() where color changes according to a variable.

*For this first exercise, set color statically*

Add information to the `geom_point()` to plot a scatterplot, with `color="red"`:  
```{r flipper-ex2a, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()

```

```{r flipper-ex2a-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(color="red")

```





### Flipper Plot - Exercise 2b
*Great job! Now let's learn how to add even more elements to the plot.*  
*We just set the color to be static (it doesn't vary). Now let's set the color to vary according to a variable.*

Add to the existing `aes()` arguments to plot a scatterplot, changing the color and shape by each species:  
```{r flipper-ex2b, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g, 
           color = ,
           shape = )) +
  geom_point()

```

```{r flipper-ex2b-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
  geom_point()

```


### Flipper Plot - Exercise 3
*Looking good. Let's keep building our plot and add a few more elements. It's often important to change the shape size and transparency. These are modified by adding* `size=` *and* `alpha=` *where alpha is the percent transparency, ranging 0-1. This information only pertains to a specific geom, so that's where you'd add it.*

As arguments inside `geom_point()`, change the point size to 3, and the alpha to 0.8:  
```{r flipper-ex3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
  geom_point()

```

```{r flipper-ex3-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8)
```



### Flipper Plot - Exercise 4
*Now let's modify some of the appearance of the plot! I added * `theme_minimal()` *to the plot to change the default theme. Notice that the background is no longer gray. How about changing these default colors to our own?*  
*Colors in ggplot can be a little confusing as there are lots of ways to do it. For now, let's set colors manually. Changing plot elements such as color or axes are done using* `scale_`. *To manually set colors you would add* `scale_color_manual()` *and within this add an argument for* `values=c()`*. Make sure to have as many values as color categories!*  
*Putting this all together, if you had two categories for colors and wanted to make them black and gray, you would add the following:*
`scale_color_manual(values = c("black","gray"))`

Change the colors for each penguin species to be darkorange, purple, and cyan4. 
```{r flipper-ex4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
    theme_minimal()

```

```{r flipper-ex4-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) 

```



### Flipper Plot - Exercise 5
*Let's keep building, we're almost done! We will probably want to change things such as the title, x- and y-axis titles, and legend title. Changing these labels is easily done using * `labs()`.
*One tricky part here is that usually you can just change the labs() for the legend using either *`color =` *or *`shape =`*. Since we've modified both, we'll have to change the title for both AND make them match.*  

*I've also added a line to the y-axis scale to make the thousands comma appear. This is tricky to remember so I just copied it here for you. *

Change the values in `labs()` to add a descriptive x-axis, y-axis, and legend title. Test what happens when the values in your `labs()` arguments `color =` and `shape =` are the same value or different!  
```{r flipper-ex5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Penguin flipper vs body mass",
       x = "",
       y = "",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "") +
  theme_minimal() 
```

```{r flipper-ex5-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Penguin flipper vs body mass",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() 
```




### Flipper Plot - Exercise 6
*Final completion!*  
*The last thing that I would recommend changing about this plot is to move the legend inside the plot. This is done using* `theme()`*. I almost always google (or look back at my old code) fpr how to do the following part so don't worry if this part isn't intuitive.*
*To manually change the legend position, within * `theme()` *use the argument * `legend.position = c(XX, YY)`*, replacing XX and YY with a value between 0 and 1. So for example, *`legend.position = c(0.7, 0.1)` *would put the legend 70% across the the plot horizontally (x) and 10% vertically. Note that this starts from the bottom left (origin).*

Move the legend inside the plot, manually placing it 20% across horizontally and 80% vertically. 
```{r flipper-ex6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Penguin flipper vs body mass",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme()


```

```{r flipper-ex6-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Penguin flipper vs body mass",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.8))

```





### Flipper Plot - Completed!
Great job! Look at this plot you've created, very neat! We can see that there is a positive relationship between flipper size and body mass, and further that this is different between different species. 

```{r flipper-review, exercise.eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Penguin flipper vs body mass",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.8))

```




## Flipper Histogram
Now that we've seen about how flippers relate to body size, let's investigate a little bit more about the data. One great way to check your data is to create a histogram or similar density plots. 


### Histograms - Exercise 1
*We'll now create a histogram of the flipper length data. We will also want to have different fill colors by each species.*

Add a histogram geom (if you can't remember how to do that, use the "Help" in RStudio, google, or auto-complete feature).   
Complete the `fill =` so that fill varies by each penguin species.  
```{r hist-ex1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = )) +
  geom_XXXXX()

```

```{r hist-ex1-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram()
```



### Histograms - Exercise 2
*Now we can see a bit about the data's distribution. However, it's hard to see the trend for each species.*  
*I've added * `position = "identity"` *to make the values not stacked which will help a bit.*  
*It's still hard to see the values underneath. We can adjust transparency using * `alpha = `*.*

*We're not going to adjust it here, but play around with the *`breaks` *argument in * `geom_histogram()`*. Try setting breaks = 20 or 40. What happens?*

Set transparency of the histogram to 0.5 (which is 50% transparent).
```{r hist-ex2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity")

```

```{r hist-ex2-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity")
```



### Histograms - Exercise 3
*It's starting to become clear! What about setting our colors to be the same color scheme as we did before?*

Manually adjust the scale of the fill values to be "darkorange", "purple", and "cyan4", using `scale_fill_manual()`. This can be a tricky step! Google or ask for help if you're stuck.
```{r hist-ex3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity")

```

```{r hist-ex3-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"))
```



### Histograms - Exercise 4
*Last step! Before we call it complete, let's make the plot finalized.*

Using `labs()` give the plot descriptive x- and y-axis labels, and a nice title. Change the theme to minimal as well. 
```{r hist-ex4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"))
```

```{r hist-ex4-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin flipper lengths") +
  theme_minimal()
```



### Histogram - Completed!
That is a clear picture of the data distribution! 

```{r histogram-review, exercise.eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin flipper lengths") +
  theme_minimal()
```



### BONUS
On a similar note, we can change `geom_histogram()` to `geom_density()`. That will smooth the breaks out and produce a nice looking plot. 

```{r densityplot, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin flipper lengths") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r densityplot-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin flipper lengths") +
  theme_minimal()
```




## Flipper Boxplot
Another way to investigate the data is to see how the quartiles overlap. We can visually show this by using a boxplot.


### Boxplot - Exercise 1
*We'll now create a boxplot of the flipper length for each species. First, let's think through our data. Boxplots only work when you have a categorical variable and a continuous variable. For this example, we'll put the categorical variable (species) on the x-axis, and continuous variable (flipper_length_mm) on the y-axis.*

Add a geom for a boxplot. In `geom_boxplot()` use the following arguments `width = 0.3` and also `show.legend = FALSE`  
```{r boxp-ex1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) 
```

```{r boxp-ex1-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE)
```



### Boxplot - Exercise 2
*Similar to before, let's keep using the same color scheme and presentation setup.*

Change scale of the color values to be "darkorange", "purple", and "cyan4". Add the minimal theme. Add labels (`labs()`) for x, y, and title. 
```{r boxp-ex2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE)
```

```{r boxp-ex2-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Flipper length (mm)",
       title = "Flipper length by species")
```



### Boxplot - Exercise 3
*Alright, now for the tricky step! Sometimes it is helpful to overlay points on a boxplot to really see your data and grab your viewers attention. But a lot of our data will overlap each other, so what to do?*  
*One trick is to "jitter" your data. This is like a scatterplot but randomly shifts each point a little bit. We will use*`geom_jitter()` *to add points on top of the boxplot.*  
*Because we're adding points on top, order matters. Make sure that *`geom_jitter()` *occurs after the *`geom_boxplot()`*.*

Add a jittered scatterplot geom with arguments `alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE, position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 0)`
```{r boxp-ex3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Flipper length (mm)",
       title = "Flipper length by species")
```

```{r boxp-ex3-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE, position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 0)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Flipper length (mm)",
       title = "Flipper length by species")
```



### Boxplot - Completed!
This is almost a publication worthy figure

```{r boxplot-review, exercise.eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE, position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 0)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Flipper length (mm)",
       title = "Flipper length by species")
```




## Bill Sizes - Simple Stats


### Bill Size - Exercise 1

Set the group and color to be grouped/colored by species. Add a scatterplot geom with `size=3` and `alpha=0.8`.
```{r bill-ex1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
 ggplot(data = penguins,
        aes(x = bill_length_mm,
            y = bill_depth_mm,
            group = ,
            color = ))
```

```{r bill-ex1-solution}
 ggplot(data = penguins,
        aes(x = bill_length_mm,
            y = bill_depth_mm,
            group = species,
            color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8)
```



### Bill Size - Exercise 2
*Alright, similar to before, let's clean up the plot and start putting some nice touches on it.*

Add the same species colors manually as in previous exercises. Add the minimal theme. Add labels using `labs()` for x, y, and color. Add the legend inside the plot at `c(0.85, 0.15)`. Hint: look at "Penguin Flipper Scatterplot, Exercise 6".
```{r bill-ex2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
 ggplot(data = penguins,
        aes(x = bill_length_mm,
            y = bill_depth_mm,
            group = species,
            color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual() +
  labs() +
  theme()
```

```{r bill-ex2-solution}
 ggplot(data = penguins,
        aes(x = bill_length_mm,
            y = bill_depth_mm,
            group = species,
            color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15))
```




### Bill Size - Exercise 3
*Finally, let's add a quick trend line. This is done using * `geom_smooth()`*. There are several options available for trend lines: *`method = "lm"` *is a linear model and * `method = "loess"` *is a loess smoother. Another useful argument in * `geom_smooth()`*is * `se=FALSE` *to turn off the error band.*  
*Since we've already grouped by species, * `geom_smooth()` *will automatically produce a line for each species.*

Add a linear trend line using `geom_smooth()` with arguments `method = "lm"` and `se = FALSE`. 
```{r bill-ex3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
        aes(x = bill_length_mm,
            y = bill_depth_mm,
            group = species,
            color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15))
```

```{r bill-ex3-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins,
        aes(x = bill_length_mm,
            y = bill_depth_mm,
            group = species,
            color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15))
```


### Bill Trendlines - Completed!
Look at those great trend lines. 

```{r bill-review, exercise.eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
        aes(x = bill_length_mm,
            y = bill_depth_mm,
            group = species,
            color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15))
```




## Simple Line Plot

### Line Plot - Intro
*One more example. For these exercises, we'll use a dataframe I created for you called *`yearcounts` *which is the number of penguins sampled in each year by species. *

Add `yearcounts` to the `head()` function to see what column names there are. 
```{r lineplot-ex0, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
head()


```

```{r lineplot-ex0-solution}
head(yearcounts)
```



### Line Plot - Exercise 1
*Now that we see the column names let's make a plot! I pasted a template from a previous example to get us started!*  

Fill in the aes() with the correctly named count variable and color by species. Change the line size to 1.5
```{r lineplot-ex1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(yearcounts, aes(x = year, y = , color = )) +
  geom_line(size = ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Total Count",
       color = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() 
```

```{r lineplot-ex1-solution}
ggplot(yearcounts, aes(x = year, y = totalcount, color = species)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Total Count",
       color = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() 
```


### Line Plot - Exercise 2
*We'll often want to manually tell R where to put the axis breaks. This is done in the * `scale_` *family of functions. In here we can also tell the plot range to be wider to more accurately display the range shown.*  
*You can either set a sequence of numbers using * `c()` *or by using the sequence function, for example: *`seq(from=0, to=10, by=2)`*. Play around with this or just use c()*

Add y-axis breaks at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. Set y-axis limits to range from 0 to 55. Add the legend inside the plot at `c(0.85, 0.15)`.  
```{r lineplot-ex2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
seq(from=0, to = 10, by = 2)

ggplot(yearcounts, aes(x = year, y = totalcount, color = species)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = , limits = c()) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Total Count",
       color = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() 
```

```{r lineplot-ex2-solution}
ggplot(yearcounts, aes(x = year, y = totalcount, color = species)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 50, by = 10), limits = c(0, 55)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Total Count",
       color = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15))
```


### Line Plot - Exercise 3
*We're close! But look at that x-axis label, yuck! Let's fix that by manually specifying breaks and how to handle the labels.*  
*I added the argument *`labels = round` to force show labels to be a whole number. 

Set the `breaks` argument in the `scale_x_continuous()` function to only show a break during each year. 
```{r lineplot-ex3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(yearcounts, aes(x = year, y = totalcount, color = species)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(, labels = round) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 50, by = 10), limits = c(0, 55)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Total Count",
       color = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15))
```

```{r lineplot-ex3-solution}
ggplot(yearcounts, aes(x = year, y = totalcount, color = species)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2007, 2008, 2009), labels = round) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 50, by = 10), limits = c(0,55)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Total Count",
       color = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15))
```



### Line Plot  - Completed!
We did it! 

```{r lineplot-review, exercise.eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(yearcounts, aes(x = year, y = totalcount, color = species)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2007, 2008, 2009), labels = round) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 50, by = 10), limits = c(0,55)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Total Count",
       color = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15))
```


### BONUS - Troubleshooting

Run the code for the plot below. I can't tell you how many times I've made a plot that looked similar. Whenever you see something that looks like this, immediately realize that you have multiple points per x value. In this case, we have several points per year. (You probably need a grouping variable, or you need to summarize your data further). This is why it's helpful to build plots piece-by-piece like we've been doing today.  
I forgot to add one tiny little detail. See if you can figure out what is missing. 
```{r lineplot-troubleshoot, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
ggplot(yearcounts, aes(x = year, y = totalcount)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2007, 2008, 2009), labels = round) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 50, by = 10), limits = c(0,55)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Total Count",
       color = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15))
```



## Facetting Plots

### Facet Plot - Exercise 1
*One other amazing feature about ggplot is the quick ability to construct a lot of plots together. Using the feature of "facets" can use one variable for each plot. We'll see shortly.*

*For this section, I've excluded those penguins which had an *`NA` *for their sex.*

Instructions: As before, add flipper length along the x-axis, body mass along the y-axis, and color by sex. Use `head()` if you need a reminder for variable names.
```{r facet-ex1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = ,
           y = ,
           color = )) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("coral2", "turquoise4"), na.translate = FALSE) 
```

```{r facet-ex1-solution}
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("coral2", "turquoise4"), na.translate = FALSE) 
```




### Facet Plot - Exercise 2
*Now let's add our standard labels and theme. Note that I added code to move the legend to the bottom.*

Instructions: Add descriptive labels and a minimal theme
```{r facet-ex2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("coral2", "turquoise4"), na.translate = FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
```

```{r facet-ex2-solution}
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("coral2", "turquoise4"), na.translate = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Penguin flipper and body mass",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin sex") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
```



### Facet Plot - Exercise 3
*Everything looks good except that we know that we have multiple species in there which throws things off. To address this, we can use a "facet" which essentially will make a new plot for each new value of a variable.*  
*To tell ggplot to plot by a variable, use function * `facet_wrap()` *To facet plot by species, within *`facet_wrap()` *write the tilde (~), followed by the variable (species in this case). There is also * `facet_grid()` *where you can specify the number of columns or rows.*

Instructions: Add a facet by species using `facet_wrap()`. 
```{r facet-ex3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("coral2", "turquoise4"), na.translate = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Penguin flipper and body mass",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin sex") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")  
```

```{r facet-ex3-solution}
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = body_mass_g,
           color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("coral2", "turquoise4"), na.translate = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Penguin flipper and body mass",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin sex") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  facet_wrap(~species)
```
